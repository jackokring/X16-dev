# X16-dev
## Development of X16 Software by Simon Jackson
This is a repository for maintaining version control.
Things will be copied across as an when necessary to
facilitate my sanity of distraction.

## Palette and Glyph Resources
A .txt file palette and a glyph .xcf file for a 256 colour export
so that later a 16 colour export is possible. Bottom two lines should have palette rows, so that the colour is not remapped by tools, and palette assignment can be automated.

## Font Resources
I think the font resources should be built from the glyph resources if necessary, but I may decide otherwise. There are more small font glyphs for example, and so some need defining.

## Logo Resource
This is a small logo to be done at 32 by 16 in 4 bpp. Just because it can be so. It also makes for a complete filling of the graphics memory at the chosen resolution for my first project demo.
