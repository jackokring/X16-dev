# X16-dev
## Development of X16 Software by Simon Jackson
This is a repository for maintaining version control.
Things will be copied across as an when necessary to
facilitate my sanity of distraction.

## Palette and Glyph Resources
A .txt file palette and a glyph .xcf file for a 256 colour export
so that later a 16 colour export is possible. Bottom two lines should have palette rows, so that the colour is not remapped by tools, and palette assignment can be automated.
